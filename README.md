# grid

Hi, this is a lil thang I'm putting together to allow people across the internet to fill in tiles of a big ol grid (mosaic sounds better). 

all important stuff is from npm so to get it set up just do (provided you have npm and node to go with it):

```
npm install
```

then, inside the parent folder:

```
npm start
```

to start the node server

Currently got a copy on [heroku](https://our-mosaic.herokuapp.com/)

enjoy?
